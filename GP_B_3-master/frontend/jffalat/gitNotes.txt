GIT Notes

*git setup:	git config --global user.name "jffalat"
			git config --global user.email "jffalat@iastate.edu"


master - the repository’s main branch. Depending on the work flow it is the one people work on or the one where the integration happens

clone - copies an existing git repository, normally from some remote location to your local environment.
	ex) git clone https://git.linux.iastate.edu/309Fall2017/GP_B_3

commit - submitting files to the repository (the local one); in other VCS it is often referred to as “checkin”
	ex) git commit -m "**NOTES**"

fetch or pull - is like “update” or “get latest” in other VCS. The difference between fetch and pull is that pull combines both, 
	fetching the latest code from a remote repo as well as performs the merging.
	ex) git pull 
	
push - is used to submit the code to a remote repository
	ex) git push -u origin master

remote - these are “remote” locations of your repository, normally on some central server.

SHA - every commit or node in the Git tree is identified by a unique SHA key. You can use them in various commands in order to manipulate a specific node.

head - is a reference to the node to which our working space of the repository currently points.

branch - is just like in other VCS with the difference that a branch in Git is actually nothing more special than a particular label on a given node. 
	It is not a physical copy of the files as in other popular VCS.
	ex) git branch
	
*Add file "filename": git add <filename>
		
*Add all files:	git add .
